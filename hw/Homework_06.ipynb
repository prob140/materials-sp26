    "- Work on some of the practice problems before starting on the homework.\n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems by yourself with the text, section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem — ask how to get started, or for a nudge to get you past where you are stuck. Always say what you have already tried. That helps us help you more effectively.\n",

But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider an alphabet of length $N$. A move-to-front permutation of the $N$ letters consists of picking one of the letters (randomly or otherwise) and moving it to the front of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the alphabet consists of the three letters A, B, and C, and you start with the permutation ABC, then CAB is the result of one move-to-front (the chosen letter is C), as is ABC (the chosen letter is A), but not CBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** As a preliminary, recall that all transition matrices are stochastic; that is, each row sums to 1. Suppose the transition matrix of a finite-state, irreducible, aperiodic chain is doubly stochastic; that is, each of its columns also sums to 1. Explain why the stationary distribution must be uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** A standard deck consists of 52 cards. A “random to front” shuffle is defined as follows: Pick one of the 52 cards uniformly at random and move it to the front of the deck (which you are welcome to think of as the top of the deck, if you prefer). Explain why if you perform this move over and over again, in the long run the deck will become well shuffled; that is, all permutations will be equally likely. [Hint: Set up an appropriate chain and use Part **a**. You might want to try it out first with an alphabet of just the letters A, B, and C.]"
