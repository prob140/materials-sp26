    "**a) [Sketching an event]** Sketching is an important problem-solving aid. For this part only, suppose $N = 6$ and $n = 10$. First convince yourself that you can think of the sample as $10$ rolls of a fair six-sided die, and $W_{10}$ as the largest of the $10$ numbers rolled.\n",

    "**c) [Using a probability model]** In Data 8, you found empirical distributions of statistics by simulation. Now you will start finding the exact distribution of a statistic by probability theory. For this, you need a probability model. Let's start with a simple one. Suppose $n$ draws are made at random with replacement from the numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}$. Let $X_i$ be the number that appears on the $i$th draw. Use Part **b** to find $P(W_n \\le k)$, for each $k$ in the range $1 \\le k \\le N$.\n",

Use your sketch in Part **a** to express the event $\\{W_n = k\\}$ in terms of any subset of the events $\\{W_n \\le 1\\}, \\{W_n \\le 2\\}, \\ldots, \\{W_n \\le N\\}$. Use this and Part **c** to find $P(W_n = k)$ for $1 \\le k \\le N$ and to show algebraically that $\\sum_{k=1}^N P(W_n = k) = 1$. Congratulations – you have found the distribution of the sample maximum for a sample of independent uniform draws from the integers 1 through $N$. \n",

For the event that the sample minimum is \"large\", fill in the blank with an appropriate mathematical symbol or English phrase. \n",
