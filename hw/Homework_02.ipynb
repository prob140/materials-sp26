    "## 1. Random Coin ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is an introduction to experiments in which randomizing a parameter can affect dependence and independence. The setting is simple but powerful: it demonstrates some fundamental ideas of Bayesian prediction. We will use the same ideas in more complex settings later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a coin that has a fixed (non-random) probability $p$ of heads. Under this assumption the tosses are independent, that is, knowing the results of some tosses doesn't change probabilities for how other tosses will come out. So for example the chance of two heads in two tosses is $p \\cdot p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see what happens when the coin is picked randomly from a bunch of different coins. In this situation, even the chance of heads is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bag of coins, a proportion $f$ of the coins are fair; assume $0 < f < 1$. Of the remaining coins, half are biased towards tails and land heads with chance 0.1. The other half land heads with chance 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "A coin is picked at random from the bag and tossed twice. Define the following events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $C_F$ is the event that the selected coin is fair, $C_T$ is the event that the selected coin is biased towards tails, and $C_H$ is the event that the selected coin is biased towards heads.\n",
    "- $H_1$ is the event that the first toss lands heads and $H_2$ is the event that the second toss lands heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Find $P(C_H)$ in terms of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Draw (by hand) a tree diagram that shows all the outcomes of picking a coin and tossing it once. The first level of the tree should be a 3-way split into sub-branches corresponding to the 3 types of coins. Each of the 3 sub-branches should then be split 2 ways corresponding to the result of the toss. That should result in 6 branches. Write the appropriate probabilities on each sub-branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Use the tree in Part **b** to calculate $P(H_1)$. Simplify the answer and notice that it is very simple. Explain the simple answer intuitively by observing a symmetry in the set of coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** Without calculation, fill in the blank with one of the symbols $>$, $<$, or $=$. Explain your reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(C_H \\mid H_1) ~ \\underline{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~} ~ P(C_H)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Now use the tree in Part **b** to calculate $P(C_H \\mid H_1)$ and show that it is consistent with your answers to Parts **a** and **d**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** Each of the 6 branches of the tree in Part **b** splits a further 2 ways corresponding to the result of the second toss. You don't have to turn in this larger tree but you should at least imagine it. Use this tree (carefully!) to fill in the blanks. Simplify your answers as much as possible. \n",

    "$P(H_2) ~ = ~ \\underline{~~~~~~~~~~~~} $ and $P(H_1H_2) ~ = ~ \\underline{~~~~~~~~~~~~}$.\n",

    "1. $P(H_1H_2) = P(H_1)P(H_2)$\n",

    "3. $P(H_2 \\mid H_1) > P(H_2)$\n",
